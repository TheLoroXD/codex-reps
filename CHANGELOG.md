## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Single entrypoint**: Merged `exercise_tracker.py` and `notify_complete.py` into `vibereps.py`
- **Stdin event routing**: Reads `hook_event_name` from stdin JSON (argv as fallback)
- **`--toggle` CLI command**: Single command to pause/resume vibereps
- **Agent session suppression**: Skips exercises for delegate/agent sessions (team sub-agents)
- **Session replay suppression**: Suppresses events within 3s of session start to prevent ghost triggers
- **Notification debounce**: Deduplicates rapid notifications within a 5s window
- **Terminal focus detection**: Desktop notifications only fire when terminal isn't the frontmost app
- **PID tracking**: Daemon writes PID to `/tmp/vibereps-daemon.pid` for reliable cleanup
- **Auto-update checker**: Non-blocking daily version check against GitHub; shows banner if update available
- **Shell tab completions**: `completions.bash` with native bash + zsh support
- **Guard.sh integration**: Installer wraps hooks with `guard.sh` if present for instant toggling
- **Terminal tab titles**: Sets terminal tab to "vibereps: exercising" / "vibereps: done"
- **VERSION file**: `VERSION` file for auto-update system
- **`/usr/local/bin/vibereps` symlink**: CLI available system-wide

### Fixed
- Notifications no longer blocked by pause check (pause gate moved into `main()`, skips notification events)

### Changed
- `--pause`, `--resume`, `--status` output changed from JSON to human-readable text
- `notify_complete.py` is now a thin deprecated wrapper forwarding to `vibereps.py`
- Hook registration simplified — same command for all events, event type from stdin

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- Pause/resume functionality — temporarily disable vibereps with `--pause` and `--resume`
- Pause state reflected in both exercise UI and Electron tray menu
- Installable `/vibereps` skill (consolidated from separate skills)
- `--webapp` flag for installer to skip Electron prompt
- Demo video on docs homepage

### Fixed
- Install script now works correctly when piped from curl
- Fixed double punctuation in install script output
- Improved notification reliability and session ID lookup

### Changed
- Default to recommended options when installer is piped (non-interactive)
- Skills symlinked to avoid duplication
- Docs updated: workflow diagram fixes, server marked as in-progress

### Release Artifacts
- `vibereps.tar.gz` — webapp files for browser-based mode
- `VibeReps.dmg` — macOS Electron menubar app (Apple Silicon / arm64)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- Window position memory - Electron app remembers where you put it
- `vibereps-usage.py` documentation with demo GIF in README and docs
- Architecture diagrams updated to show local JSONL logging flow

### Fixed
- Camera light stays off until window is actually shown (deferred enumeration)
- Camera stops when Electron window is hidden (no more always-on light)
- Window bounds validation requires 100px visible (prevents off-screen windows)
- Fixed 'Object has been destroyed' errors in Electron
- Fixed exercise logging in Electron - use IPC instead of HTTP
- Fixed IndentationError in exercise_tracker.py (now vibereps.py) for UserPromptSubmit hook
- Fixed MediaPipe loading race conditions

### Changed
- Responsive UI scaling with distance-based font sizing
- Updated hooks documentation to mark prompt trigger mode as experimental
- Added attribution to ccusage as inspiration for usage tracking

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- Electron menubar app for macOS with multi-instance session tracking
- Async hook execution (`"async": true`) for non-blocking operation
- `VIBEREPS_DISABLED` environment variable to disable tracking
- `VIBEREPS_UI_MODE` environment variable (electron/webapp)
- `VIBEREPS_TRIGGER_MODE` environment variable (edit-only/prompt)
- Smart prompt detection for `user_prompt_submit` mode
- Session manager for tracking multiple Claude instances
- Bundled MediaPipe for offline use in Electron app
- DMG distribution support

### Fixed
- XSS vulnerability in exercise_ui.html (escaped HTML in dynamic content)

### Changed
- Two-tier port architecture: Electron uses 8800, webapp uses 8765-8774
- Notification hook matcher changed to `idle_prompt|permission_prompt`

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- `--dangerously-skip-leg-day` feature via `VIBEREPS_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_LEG_DAY=1`
- `vibereps-usage.py` for combined Claude Code + exercise stats
- `config.json` with array of taglines
- 11 exercise types with JSON-based configuration

### Changed
- Exercise configs moved from hardcoded JS to `exercises/*.json`
- Simplified monitoring: removed Prometheus/Grafana, now uses local JSONL + ccusage

### Fixed
- Daemon now detects when browser window closes
- Shorter timeout for quick mode (2 min vs 10 min)

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-13

### Added
- Initial release
- PostToolUse hook integration for Claude Code
- Real-time pose detection with MediaPipe
- Quick mode (5 reps) and normal mode (10+ reps)
- Desktop notifications when Claude is ready
- Local exercise logging to JSONL
- Optional remote server for stats and leaderboards
